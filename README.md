Task 02 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Competition

File Used: train.csv

Objective
Perform data cleaning on the dataset

Handle missing values appropriately

Explore relationships between different variables

Identify patterns affecting passenger survival

Tools and Technologies
Python

Google Colab

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Data Cleaning Performed
Filled missing values in the Age column using the median

Filled missing values in the Embarked column using the most frequent value

Removed the Cabin column due to a large number of missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:

Overall survival count

Survival comparison by gender

Survival comparison by passenger class

Age distribution of passengers

Correlation analysis using a heatmap

Key Insights
Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in first class had better survival chances

Younger passengers were more likely to survive

Gender and passenger class significantly influenced survival

How to Run the Project
Upload titanic.zip to Google Colab

Unzip the dataset

Run the notebook cells sequentially

Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis provided valuable insights into the Titanic dataset and helped understand the factors influencing passenger survival. This analysis is useful as a foundation for further machine learning modeling.
